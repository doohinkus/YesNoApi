## Yes No Api
This the first version of an API that I'm building for a React Driven Website. More to come.

 npm start
```
* For Yes or Not open browser to http://localhost:3000/yesno
* For Heads or Tails open browser to http://localhost:3000/flip
* For Stop or Go open browser to http://localhost:3000/traffic
