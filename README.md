## Yes No Api
This the first version of an API that I'm building for a React Driven Website. More to come.
## Giphy API Key
This requires a Giphy API key to work.
* Get free Giphy Api key from https://developers.giphy.com/
* In the project directory where the package.json resides, create a file named 'secret.js':
```javascript
module.exports = 'YOUR API KEY GOES HERE';
```
## To Run
Install dependencies
```javascript
 npm install
```
Once they are installed, run the server:
```javascript
 npm start
```
